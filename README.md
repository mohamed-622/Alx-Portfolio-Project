### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed-622/Alx-Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PitchBooking
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


### Using a Virtual Environment

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for your project, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set up and activate a virtual environment:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory.

2. Create a virtual environment using the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    If you are using Python 3, you might need to use `python3` instead.

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Once the virtual environment is activated, you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

5. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now, your project is set up within a virtual environment, and you can run it with the isolated dependencies.



## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. Explore the application, sign up, log in, and start booking your slots!
